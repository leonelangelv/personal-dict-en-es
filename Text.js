Emily: I've finalized the UI design for the feature. Alex, I'll send you the mockups by noon.

Mark: I've been reviewing the user stories and refining some acceptance criteria. Sarah, I think we're on track for the sprint review next week.

Sarah: Great to hear, Mark. Let's aim to wrap up testing by Thursday and plan for a demo on Friday. Anything else we should discuss?

Emily: Just a heads-up, Sarah. We might need some UX feedback before finalizing the designs.
